    <h1 id="title">[PROPOSED] Timed Media Working Group Charter</h1>

    <p class="mission">The
    <strong>mission</strong> of the Timed Media Working Group is to
    further develop timed media capabilities in the Open Web Platform, including but not limited to video and audio features.</p>

    <p>The Timed Media Working Group will expand upon the basic capabilities provided by HTML5's <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> media elements as well as develop lower level APIs that provide the foundation for features developed by the Audio Working Group, the WebRTC Working Group, and others.</p>

    <div class="goals">
      <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

      <p>The Web is increasingly used to share and consume timed media (including video and audio). The Timed Media Working Group will work on specifications for enhancing these experiences through new mark-up and APIs. Several other working groups (such as the Audio Working Group and the Web Real-Time Communications Working Group) are building sophisticated capabilities that need a common basic set of "bedrock" APIs. The Timed Media Working Group will coordinate the requirements from these and other groups and produce specifications to address these needs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scope">
      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

      <p>The scope of the Timed Media Working Group covers technologies related to the capture, acquisition, orchestration and playback of timed media such as video and audio. The Timed Media Working Group deliverables must address issues of <strong>accessibility, device independence, interoperability, mobility, privacy, and security</strong>. The Working Group should address the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements</a>, and features that aid accessibility such as captions and transcripts are in scope. Functionality to coordinate other interactions with timed events in the media files is in scope.</p>

	  <h3>Success Criteria</h3>

    <p>In order to advance beyond Candidate Recommendation, each specification is expected to have at least:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification;</li>
     <li>A test suite that provides evidence to support the position that there is good (though perhaps not perfect) interoperability;</li>
     <li>Remaining differences in implementations have little impact on usage on the Web</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Out of Scope</h3>

   <p>The group will not work on developing codecs, new media formats, security protocols, or new encryption algorithms.</p>
   <p>The group will not work on audio processing APIs or real-time communication but will liaise with the Audio Working Group and the Web Real-Time Communications Working Group to ensure lower level capabilities
    created by the Timed Media Working Group are compatible with those groups' goals.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="deliverables">
        <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

        <h3 id="rec-track">Recommendation-Track Deliverables</h3>
        <p>The working group will deliver the following W3C Recommendations:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/">Media Source Extensions</a></dt>
          <dd>A specification that extends HTMLMediaElement to allow JavaScript to generate media streams for playback. Allowing JavaScript to generate streams facilitates a variety of use cases like adaptive streaming and time shifting live streams.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/">Encrypted Media Extensions</a></dt>
          <dd>This specification extends HTMLMediaElement providing APIs to control playback of protected content. The API supports use cases ranging from simple clear key decryption to high value video (given an appropriate user agent implementation). License/key exchange is controlled by the application, facilitating the development of robust playback applications supporting a range of content decryption and protection technologies.</dd>
        <dt>Low Level Audio and Video support</dt>
        <dd>The Timed Media Working Group will work on low-level media APIs to support the work of the <a href='http://www.w3.org/2011/audio/'>Audio</a> and <a href='http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/'>Web Real-Time Communications</a> Working Groups.</dd>
        </dl>

      <h3 id="maintenance">Specification Maintenance</h3>
      <p>The Timed Media Working Group will maintain errata and new editions, as necessary, for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/embedded-content-0.html#htmlmediaelement">HTMLMediaElement</a> related sections of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/">HTML 5.0</a> (e.g. sections 4.7.6 to 4.7.10). When future versions of HTML are published as modules, the working
      group will deliver future versions of these timed media features as a W3C Recommendation.</p>

	    <h3>Other Deliverables</h3>
      <p>The Timed Media Working Group may produce specifications for the following features:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Transcript</dt>
        <dd>If the current <a href="http://w3c.github.io/html-transcript/html-transcript-src.html">Transcript proposal</a> gains implementation support and momentum, this Group will adopt the proposal.</dd>
        <dt>Captioning support</dt>
        <dd>The group may produce a specification to enhance the timed text and caption API support available to HTML5 media elements.</dd>
        <dt>Inband Track Support</dt>
        <dd>If the <a href='https://www.w3.org/community/inbandtracks/'>Media Resource In-band</a> Tracks Community Group produces a <a href='http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-sourcing-inband-tracks/'>mature specification</a> with implementation support then the Timed Media Working Group may adopt this work onto the Recommendation Track.</dd>
        <dt>Media Capture</dt>
        <dd>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/">WebRTC</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/">Device APIs Working Groups</a> have been collaborating in the Media Capture Task force on the development of specifications that enable the capture and processing of media streams. Upon the request of these groups, the Timed Media Working Group may adopt the further development and maintenance of these specifications.</dd>
        <dt>Synchronization</dt>
        <dd>If the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/">Multi-Device Timing Community Group</a> produces a <a href='http://webtiming.github.io/timingobject/'>mature specification</a> with implementation support, then the Timed Media Working Group may adopt this work onto the Recommendation Track.</dd>

      </dl>

      <p>The Working Group may use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Community Group</a> or other Community Groups to explore possible new work within its scope that is not covered in the deliverables above. If the Working Group decides to add new features or specifications to its deliverables, it will recharter with changes to that new charter limited to just changes in deliverables.</p>

    <div class="participation">
      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

      <p>To be successful, the Timed Media Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, and to have the participation of industry leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it produces.</p>

      <p>The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute one day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants. This Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for building Test Suites for each specification.</p>

      <p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="communication">
      <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
        <p>
        The Working Group <strong>conducts its work primarily through GitHub repositories</strong>, for contributions and communications. There will be one GitHub repository per document. Similar to open-source software development, peer production is encouraged: changes will be executed through Pull Requests, where each pull request gets preferably reviewed before being merged.
        Regular activity summaries around the GitHub repositories MUST be provided.</p>
        <p>The Group may also use a mailing list. Subscription
          to these lists is open to the public, subject to W3C norms of
          behavior. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="decisions">
      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus" shape="rect">section
      3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there
      is consensus.
      The expectation is that typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required. However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs should put a question out for voting within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.</p>

      <p>Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is to be considered provisional until 10 working days after the publication of the resolution in Call for Consensus sent to the working group's mailing list. If no objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>

      <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes" shape="rect">Section
        3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no
        voting procedures beyond what the Process Document
        requires.</p>
