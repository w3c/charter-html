        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The Web Platform Working Group will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>continue the development of the HTML language, and associated APIs;</li>
          <li>ensure that developers can use Web technologies to build client-side applications that rely on Web engines as application runtime environments;</li>
          <li>provide generic and consistent interoperability and integration among all target formats, such as HTML, CSS, and SVG.</li>
          <li>continue to define normative requirements for applications that process HTML resources, including (but not limited to) browsers and other interactive user agents, as well as authoring tools, markup generators, and conformance checkers;</li>
          <li>ensure universal access to Web applications across a wide range of devices and among a diversity of users, by addressing issues of accessibility, device independence, internationalization, mobility, privacy, and security.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
           The Web Platform Working Group will rely on modularity as a key part of the development of the HTML language, allowing extension specifications to define new elements, new attributes, new values for attributes that accept defined sets of keywords, and new APIs. Those extension specifications may be defined within the Web Platform Working Group or other Groups.
        </p>
      <div>
        <h3 id="success">Success Criteria</h3>
    <p>The Working Groupâ€™s work will be considered a success if its deliverables that are widely used. In particular:
    <ul>
      <li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items
      listed in the <a href="#milestones">Milestones</a> section.
      <li>Test suites for each deliverable with conformance criteria.
      <li>Availability of authoring tools and validation tools.
      <li>User-community and industry adoption of the group deliverables.
      <li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable browser
        implementations of each deliverable with normative conformance
        requirements for browser implementations, as demonstrated by an
        implementation report (summarizing implementation status against
        the relevant test suite).
      <li>If participants from fewer than three distinct browser-engine
        projects are participating in the group, its charter should be
        re-examined by the W3C.

        <p>After a specification reaches Recommendation status the working group
          may begin work on, and deliver an updated version of the specification

          other work which depends on a stable reference.</p>
        <p>The Working Group will not adopt new proposals until they have
          matured through the <a href="incubator-cg-charter.html">Web Platform
          Incubator Community Group</a> or another similar incubation phase. If

        <h3 id="other-deliverables">Other Deliverables</h3>
        <p>Other non-normative documents may be created such as:</p>
        <div id="ig-other-deliverables">
          <ul>
            <li>Test suites for each specification</li>
            <li>Primers for each specification</li>
            <li>Requirements documents for new specifications</li>
            <li>Non-normative schemas for language formats</li>
            <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
            necessary to ensure the specification's robustness, consistency, and
            implementability, and to promote interoperability between User
            Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
            suite, which should be completed before transition to Candidate Recommendation,
            and must be completed, with an implementation report, before
            transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation.
            Additional tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the
            Recommendation track, and the maintenance of a implementation report
            is encouraged. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Adding new Recommendation-track deliverables</h3>

        <p>If additional deliverables need to be added to the Charter before the Charter expires, the Working Group will prepare an updated Charter that differs only in deliverables. In the interest of agile spec development, the group requests that the Advisory Committee and Director restrict approval reviews for those Charter deliverables adjustments to just the changes in the Charter, rather than considering the entire Charter again for review.</p>
        <h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>
        <p>The group's <a href="https://w3c.github.com/webplatform-wg/PubStatus.md">Specification Status</a>
	  document provides current data about all of the group's specifications,
	  including Technical Report publication plans and testing status.
	  Although the group expects all of its specifications to progress during this
	  charter period, the charter does not include detailed <em>milestone</em>
	  data for each specification because such data is speculative and easily
	  becomes out of date. Nevertheless, the following specifications are
	  considered <em>priorities</em> for the group because some other group
	  has a dependency on the specification. For each of these specifications,
	  some milestone predictions are provided, but please see the
	  <a href="https://w3c.github.com/webplatform-wg/PubStatus.md">Specification Status</a>
	  document for accurate data.</p>
	<ul>
    <li>Web Storage (2nd edition): Recommendation expected in 2015</li>
    <li>Web Workers: Recommendation expected in 2015</li>
    <li>Web Sockets: Recommendation expected in 2015</li>
	  <li>XHR; Recommendation expected in early 2016</li>

      <div class="dependencies">
        <h2 id="coordination">Dependencies and Liaisons</h2>
        <h3>Dependencies</h3>
        <p>A number of specifications depend on the WebIDL specification, which
          is therefore a very high priority for the Working Group. </p>
        <p>The Web Sockets specification has an effective dependency on the
          protocol defined by the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/hybi-charter.html">IETF's
            HyBi Working Group</a>. </p>

	<p>
	  Given the large number of deliverables and therefore also
dependencies between this working group and accessibility groups, the
Web Platform team contact(s) will liaise with the team contact for Accessible Platform Architectures and Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Groups
in order to ensure early identification of specifications with
potential accessibility aspects, and to ensure coordination as needed
during their development.
        </p>

        <p>The specifications of several other groups, such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG"> SVG</a>, depend upon
          particular Web Platform Working Group specifications.
          Where possible, additional dependencies will be
          avoided to prevent the disruption of dependent deliverables. </p>
        <h3 id="liaisons">Liaisons</h3>

            <dt><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm" id="tc39">ECMA

              Working Group will be developing ECMAScript APIs, it should
              collaborate with TC39.</dd>
            <dt><a title="IETF Home Page" href="http://www.ietf.org/" id="ietf">Internet

            <dd>The IETF is responsible for defining robust and secure protocols
              for Internet functionality. A close relationship with the IETF
              HTTP group is crucial to ensuring the good design, deployment, and
              success of protocol-based APIs such as CORS and Web Sockets. This
              Working Group will rely upon review and parallel progress of
              associated specifications, and will keep pace with the IETF's HTTP
              and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/hybi-charter.html">HyBi</a>
              groups' work, conditional upon steady progress. The working group
              may well also liaise with the IETFs Web Security Working Group,

        <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
        <p>To be successful, the Web Platform Working Group is expected to
          have 10 or more active participants for its duration, and to have the
          participation of industry leaders in fields relevant to the
          specifications it produces.</p>
        <p>The Chairs, specification Editors and test Facilitators are expected
          to contribute one to two days per week towards the Working Group.
          There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.</p>
        <p>The Web Platform Working Group welcomes participation, with

        <p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.com/webplatform-wg/WorkMode.md">working
            mode</a> of the group is described in detail on its wiki. In general
          the group does not hold plenary teleconferences, but does meet face to face at the
          TP/AC. It may hold more meetings, and certain specifications are
          developed with regular teleconferences. Note the <a href="#decisions">Decision
            Policy</a> below with regards to meetings. </p>
        <p>
        The Working Group <strong>conduct their work primarily through github repositories</strong>,
        for contributions and communications. Discourse may be used for broad discussions with the community.
        There will be one github repository per document. Similar to open-source software development,
        peer production is encouraged: changes will be executed through Pull Requests, with pull requests reviewed before being merged.
        Regular activity summaries around the github repositories MUST be provided.</p>
        <p>The Group may use mailing lists. Subscription
          to these lists is open to the public, subject to W3C norms of
          behavior. </p>
        <p>Up-to-date information about the group (for example, details about
          deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants) is available from

        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>As explained in the W3C Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
            3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
          consensus and with due process. The expectation is that typically, an
          editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then
          refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs should put a question out for voting within the
          group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for
          example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and record a
          decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be
          considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
          available.</p>
        <p>Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is
          to be considered provisional until 10 working days after the
          publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the working
          groups mailing list. If no objections are raised on the mailing list
          within that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group. </p>
        <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section
