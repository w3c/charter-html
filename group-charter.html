        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The Web Platform Working Group was the result of merging the Web Applications Working Group and the
          HTML Working Group, with some deliverables moved to other groups. The work boundaries between the two
          Working Groups had narrowed over the years, given that it is difficult to introduce new
          HTML elements and attributes without looking at their implications at the API level.</p>
        <p>The initial experiment in merging the group for 12 months suggests that it is a reasonable path to continue.
          This charter therefore provides an 18 month extension, removes some deliverables considered unlikely
          to progress within that period, and includes others but with a specific requirement that there is a
          prospect of success before work will continue within the Working Group.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The group will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Continue the development of the HTML language, and associated APIs.</li>
          <li>Ensure that developers can use Web technologies to build client-side applications that rely on Web engines
            as application runtime environments.</li>
          <li>Provide generic and consistent interoperability and integration among all target formats, such as HTML, CSS,
            and SVG.</li>
          <li>Continue to define normative requirements for applications that process HTML resources, including browsers
            and other interactive user agents, authoring tools, content management tools, and conformance checkers.</li>
          <li>Ensure Web applications can work across a wide range of devices and among a broad diversity of users, in particular
            addressing issues of accessibility, device independence, internationalization, privacy, and security.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Web Platform Working Group should develop modular specifications to the greatest extent possible for the
          development of the HTML language, allowing extension specifications to define new elements, new attributes,
          new values for attributes that accept defined sets of keywords, and new APIs.</p>

      <section>
        <h3 id="success">Success Criteria</h3>
    <p>The group will be considered successful if it produces</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stable versions of specifications addressing the work items listed in the
        <a href="#milestones">Milestones</a> section, with normative conformance requirements for implementation</li>
      <li>A test suite for each deliverable, sufficiently broad to demonstrate interoperability.</li>
      <li>Implementation reports for deliverables showing adoption.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Resulting in the ready availability of multiple, independent, interoperable implementations of each deliverable,
      including in browsers, authoring and validation tools, and usage on the Web.</p>
    <p>If participants from fewer than three distinct browser-engine projects are participating in the group,
      its charter should be re-examined by the W3C.</p>

        <h4>Potential deliverables</h4>
        <p>The following deliverables may be developed as Recommendation track documents, if they have had sufficient incubation
          to expect success:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><a href="https://w3c.github.io/ime-api/">Input Method (IME) API</a></dt>
           <dd>An API that provides access to a (native) input method editor.</dd>

           <dd>Defines an approach for creating packages of files for use on the web.</dd>
          <dt><a href="https://w3c.github.io/quota-api/">Quota Management API</a></dt>
           <dd>An API for managing the amount of storage space (short- or long-term) available.</dd>
          <dt id="robust-anchoring"><a href='http://w3c.github.io/findtext/'>FindText API</a></dt>
           <dd>APIs for linking to a document selection, even when the document
            has changed. This is a joint deliverable with the Web
            Annotation WG.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/">HTML Imports</a></dt>
           <dd>A way to include and reuse HTML documents in another HTML documents.</dd>
          <dt><a href="https://slightlyoff.github.io/BackgroundSync/spec/">Web Background Synchronization</a></dt>
           <dd>A specification describing a method that enables Web applications to synchronize data when next online.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Each specification should detail any known security implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
        <p>The Web Platform WG will actively seek security, privacy, internationalization and accessibility review on all
          its specifications.</p>
        <p>If a specification reaches Recommendation status the working group may work on, and deliver an updated version
          of the specification under this charter. Specifications may be moved to Recommendation and a subsequent version begun
          to facilitate the progress of other work which depends on a stable reference.</p>
        <p>The Working Group will not adopt new proposals until they have
          matured through the <a href="incubator-cg-charter.html">Web Platform
          Incubator Community Group</a> or another similar incubation phase. If
          the Working Group decides to add new Recommendation-track deliverables
          then it will recharter with changes to that new charter limited to
          just the changes in deliverables.</p>
        <p>For current information on the list of deliverables and their status see the Web Platform WG
          <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webplatform-wg/PubStatus.md">Publication Status</a> page.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
            necessary to ensure the specification's robustness, consistency, and
            implementability, and to promote interoperability between User
            Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
            suite, which should be completed before transition to Candidate Recommendation,
            and must be completed, with an implementation report, before
            transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation.
            Additional tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the
            Recommendation track, and the maintenance of a implementation report
            is encouraged. </p>

        <p>The group's <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webplatform-wg/PubStatus.md">Publication Status</a>
	  document provides current data about all of the group's specifications.
	  Although the group expects all of its active deliverables to progress during this
	  charter period, the charter does not include detailed <em>milestone</em> data for each specification because
          such data is speculative and easily becomes out of date. The Working Group does expect the following to occur:</p>
	<ul>
          <li>HTML 5.2 Recommendation in Q4 2017</li>
          <li>HTML 5.3 First Public Working Draft in Q3 2017</li>
          <li>IndexedDB version 2 Candidate Recommendation in Q1 2017</li>
          <li>IndexedDB version 3 First Public Working Draft in Q1 2017</li>
          <li>Web Sockets: Recommendation expected in 2017</li>
	  <li>DOM Parsing and Serialization: Recommendation expected in 2017</li>
	  <li>Web IDL: Recommendation expected in early 2017</li>

              <dd>The IETF is responsible for defining robust and secure protocols for Internet functionality. A
                close relationship with the IETF HTTP group is crucial to ensuring the good design, deployment, and success
                of protocol-based APIs such as CORS and Web Sockets. This Working Group will rely upon review and parallel
                progress of associated specifications, and will keep pace with the IETF's HTTP and
                <a href="http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/hybi-charter.html">HyBi</a> groups' work, conditional upon steady
                progress. The working group may also liaise with the IETFs Web Security Working Group, either directly or

        <p>To be successful, the Web Platform Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration,
          and to have the participation of industry leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it produces.</p>
        <p>The Chairs, specification Editors and test Facilitators are expected to contribute one to two days per week

        <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">working mode</a> of the group is described in detail on its wiki.
          In general the group does not hold plenary teleconferences, but does meet face to face at the TPAC. It may hold
          more meetings, and certain specifications are developed with regular teleconferences. Note the
          <a href="#decisions">Decision Policy</a> below with regards to meetings. </p>
        <p>The Working Group conducts its work primarily through
          <a href='https://github.com/orgs/w3c/teams/WebPlatformWG/repositories'>GitHub repositories</a>.
        <p>The Group uses mailing lists. Subscription to these lists is open to the public, subject to W3C norms of
          behavior. </p>

        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>As required by the W3C Process Document
         (<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this group will seek to make
          decisions when there is consensus and with due process. The expectation is that, an editor or other participant makes
          an initial proposal, which is refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>If a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the
          range of views presented, the Chairs may put a question out for voting within the group  to allow for asynchronous
          participation, using the mechanism noted in the group's
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/WebPlatformWG/blob/gh-pages/WorkMode.md">Work Mode</a>
          documents, and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be considered resolved
          unless and until new information becomes available.</p>
        <p><strong>Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is to be considered provisional until
          10 (ten) working days after the publication of the resolutions in meeting minutes sent to the appropriate working
          group mailing list as described in the
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/WebPlatformWG/blob/gh-pages/WorkMode.md">Work Mode</a> documents. If no objections
          are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group.</strong></p>
        <p>This charter is written in accordance with
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section 3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document
